COMP257/ITEC657 Data Science Portfolio 
===

This repository will hold your portfolio projects for this semester. You should customise this README.md file
to document your own work - add your name and details and describe what you've done.  This will be displayed
on your Github page.

Name: SUHASH REDDY IMMAREDDY - 45693242
Sub: Intro to Data Science

There are three Portfolio's 

1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling 
   1) Firstly I tried to understand the type of Data that is present in the strav and cheetah file.
   2) Did an Inner join on the two files to get the combined one which now contains the rows that are in common in both and them removed the rows with no measured power.
   3) Later I tried to look at the distributions of some of the columns namely TSS, TIME, AVERAGE POWER, AVERAGE SPEED and soo on....
   4) Then I tried to look at any relationships between the variable selected (Here pairplot shows the distribution and correlation matrix shows the correlation)
   5) Then I explored the differences between three categories Race, Workout and Ride with the variables that are selected above.
   6) Later I tried to look at what's leading to more Kudos(More likes) and inclueded the ones that are consistent.
   

2. I tried to replicate most of the results that are shown in the research paper on Aplliances 
   1) Firstly I did some Data Exploration to understand the data and then added some columsn that would help us in plotting the graphs and heatmaps.
   2) I replicated the boxplot and Histogram for Appliances
   3) I replicated the line graph of Appliances with weekly and monthly usage
   4) I replicated the hourly energy consumption for a week in heatmaps
   5) I tried to look at the correlation and distribution of all the features with Appliances
   6) I tried the Linear regression and Random Forest Regression on the data and looked at the Interpretations to comment
   7) I tried to get the Variable importance but the values that are currently displayed are not upto the mark.


3. Here I tried to show how the Kmeans Clustering would work by making use of the ecludian distance
   1) Firstly we generated some random Data and plotted 4 random centroids
   2) Initally calculated which point is closer to which ,then calculating the new centroids and repeating the proces itteratively untill the new centroids does not have a change in the position.
